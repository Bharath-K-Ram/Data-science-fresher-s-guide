# Machine Learning Algorithms to Learn 
#### (bharathkram)
To understand algorithm you have to piece together an understanding yourself from desprate description.

Ask the questions below to yourself to get a better understanding of an algorithm
What is the objective and goal of the algorithm ?.
What is the psuedo code or flowchart description of the algorithm ?
What class of problem is the algorithm well suited ?
What are the rules of thumb for using the algorithm ?
What metaphors or analogies are commonly used to describe the behavior of the algorithm?
What are he useful resources for learning more about the algorithm ?
What are the primary resource or referrence in which the algorithm was first described ?



## Regression Algorithms
* Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Stepwise Regression

## Instance-based Algorithms
* k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
* Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
* Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
* Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
